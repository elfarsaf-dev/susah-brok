The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failed with an error indicating that a Netlify Function (`api.js`) failed to require one of its dependencies (`serverless-http`), which is not present in the site's top-level `package.json`.

**Solution:**
1. Verify that the `serverless-http` package is included in the site's top-level `package.json` file or was committed to the repository.
2. Add `serverless-http` to the top-level `package.json` dependencies. If it's already in `package.json`, ensure it is properly installed and available during the build process.
